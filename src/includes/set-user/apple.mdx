```swift
let user = User()
user.email = "john.doe@example.com"
SentrySDK.setUser(user)
```

```objc
SentryUser *user = [[SentryUser alloc] init];
user.email = @"john.doe@example.com";
[SentrySDK setUser:user];
```

Since 6.0.1: If no user is set the SDK uses the installation id of the SDK as the
user id of the event before queuing it for submission.
